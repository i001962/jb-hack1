This app allows you to chat with any ETH user just by entering their key in the url: `/?chat=<ETH>`. It could be used, for instance, to chat with the creator of a project on JuiceBox. (you can do that when you go to the app, the default ID is 95 and it provides a "chatSupport" which automatically fills the eth key for you to chat with the adress.)

If you wanna chat with me: [chat with @noctisatrae](https://jb-hack1.vercel.app/?chat=0x84673f99d9807780ce5Db4c3A980d708535d9604). I'll be waiting for you all. Flood my inbox kind stranger!
